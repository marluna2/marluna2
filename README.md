I'm marluna, just a guy living in Germany, born in 2008.

I love anything with big electric motors, turbines, high pressure air or water, and fire.

Building and repairing stuff is my hobby, I even have my own workshop for just that.

I have a YouTube channel where I ... sometimes... upload something, be it video games or real stuff. (quality not included)

If you have a question or something cool to share with me, you can just email me or something.
